Abstract = {Sleep deprivation alters attentional functions like vigilance or tonic
   alerting (i.e., sustaining an alert state over a period of time).
   However, the effects of sleep loss on both orienting and executive
   control are still not clear, and no study has assessed whether sleep
   deprivation might affect the relationships among these three attentional
   systems. In order to investigate the efficiency of the three attentional
   networks-alerting, orienting and executive control-within a single task,
   we used the Attention Network Test (ANT). Eighteen right-handed male
   participants took part in the experiment, which took place on two
   consecutive days. On the first day, each participant performed a 20 min
   training session of the ANT. On the second day, participants remained
   awake for 24 h during which time the ANT was performed once at 5:00 p.m.
   and once at 4:00 a.m. Results showed an overall slowing of reaction
   times in the nocturnal session, indicating a strong decrease in
   vigilance. Furthermore, sleep deprivation did affect attentional
   orienting and executive control. Results are consistent with the
   hypothesis that the tonic component of alerting interacts with both
   attentional orienting and executive functions.},

Abstract = {Studies of neurocognitive functioning suggest that child molesters can
   be differentiated into offender types based on frontal neurocognitive
   (executive) functioning. The aim of this study was to examine
   performance on cognitive tests that assess processing speed, cognitive
   flexibility, executive control and working memory in two samples of
   child molesters (incestuous and non-incestuous) compared with an age-and
   education-matched control group of non-offenders. These groups were
   matched for clinical, sociodemographic and criminological
   characteristics. Our results suggest that cognitive measures of
   executive functioning (i.e., processing speed, cognitive flexibility and
   executive control) differentiate child molesters from non-offender
   participants, and that working memory performance in incestuous child
   molesters differentiates this group from non-incestuous offenders and
   control participants. These findings suggest specific components of
   impaired cognitive performance in incestuous child molesters relative to
   extra-familial offenders and non-offender control participants. Poorer
   working memory in incestuous child molesters may help differentiate this
   group from other child molester types.},

Abstract = {This study examined the relations between properties of attentional
   networks and Mind Wandering (MW) across individuals. For the attentional
   networks, we measured three components of attention, known as alerting,
   orienting, and executive control, using the Attention Network Test
   (ANT). To investigate MW, we measured thought probes embedded in the
   Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART). Moreover, four performance
   characteristics of the SART were calculated as behavioral indices of MW.
   Three of them showed significant associations with probed MW. Most
   research regarding MW focused on its relation to executive functions,
   while the present study revealed that MW, as indexed by self-reports and
   RT variability, was negatively correlated with orienting, specifically
   the exogenous orienting system. Furthermore, there was a positive
   association between RT variability and executive control. Our results
   suggest that individuals with higher tendency of MW are less sensitive
   to irrelevant external stimuli, supporting the decoupling hypothesis of
   MW. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Executive Functions in Children Who Experience Bullying Situations},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 26},
Abstract = {Bullying is characterized by intentional, repetitive, and persistent
   aggressive behavior that causes damage to the victim. Many studies
   investigate the social and emotional aspects related to bullying, but
   few assess the cognitive aspects it involves. Studies with aggressive
   individuals indicate impairment in executive functioning and decision
   making. The objective of this study was to assess hot and cold executive
   functions in children who experience bullying. A total of 60 children
   between 10 and 11 years of age were included in the study. They were
   divided into four groups: aggressors (bullies), victims, bully -victims,
   and control. Tests for decision -making, inhibitory control, working
   memory, and cognitive flexibility were used. The bully group made more
   unfavorable choices on the Iowa Gambling Task, which may indicate
   difficulties in the decision making process. The victim group took
   longer to complete the Trail Making Test (Part B) than aggressors,
   suggesting lower cognitive flexibility in victims. The hypothesis that
   aggressors would have lower performance in other executive functions
   such as inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility
   has not been confirmed. This study indicates that bullies have an
   impairment of hot executive functions whereas victims have a
   comparatively lower performance in cold executive functions. In addition
   to social and cultural variables, neurocognitive and emotional factors
   seem to influence the behavior of children in bullying situations.},

Abstract = {Analogical reasoning (AR) is a cornerstone of human cognition. Two main
   theories have historically been proposed to account for the ontogeny of
   AR. They propose that analogical skills are constrained by children's
   logical skills or limited knowledge of the relations to be considered.
   We adopt an alternative perspective in this review paper suggesting that
   AR abilities depend on the efficiency of executive control. We present
   convergent data collected in children and monkeys highlighting the role
   of three main executive functions: inhibitory control, cognitive
   flexibility and working memory updating. The analysis of children's
   reasoning suggests that the contribution of relational knowledge and
   executive control to analogical reasoning cannot be considered
   independently. (C) 2013 Societe francaise de psychologie. Published by

Title = {Distinct alterations in value-based decision-making and cognitive
   control in suicide attempters: Toward a dual neurocognitive model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {151},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1120-1124},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective: The literature suggests that many suicide attempters show
   impairment in both decision-making and cognitive control. However, it is
   not clear if these deficits are linked to each other, and if they may be
   related to more basic alterations in attention. This is a relevant
   question in the perspective of future interventions targeting cognitive
   deficits to prevent suicidal acts.
   Method: Two different populations of patients with histories of suicide
   attempts were assessed (N=142 and 119). The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) was
   used to measure decision-making in both populations. We used a D2
   cancellation task and a verbal working memory task in population 1; the
   Stroop test, the N-Back task, the Trail Making Test, and the Hayling
   Sentence Completion test in population 2.
   Results: Regarding decision-making, we only found a small negative
   correlation between the Hayling test error score (r = -0.24; p=0.01),
   and the net score from the second half of the IGT. In contrast, working
   memory, cognitive flexibility and cognitive inhibition measures were
   largely inter-correlated.
   Limitation: Most patients were medicated. Only patients with mood
   disorders.
   Conclusion: These results add to previous findings suggesting that the
   neurocognitive vulnerability to suicidal behavior may rely on
   impairments in two distinct anatomical systems, one processing
   value-based decision-making (associated with ventral prefrontal cortex,
   among others) and one underlying cognitive control (associated with more
   dorsal prefrontal regions). This distinction may result in tailored-made
   cognitive interventions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this review, we provide an overview of how age-related changes in
   executive control influence aging effects in arithmetic processing. More
   specifically, we consider the role of executive control in strategic
   variations with age during arithmetic problem solving. Previous studies
   found that age-related differences in arithmetic performance are
   associated with strategic variations. That is, when they accomplish
   arithmetic problem-solving tasks, older adults use fewer strategies than
   young adults, use strategies in different proportions, and select and
   execute strategies less efficiently. Here, we review recent evidence,
   suggesting that agerelated changes in inhibition, cognitive flexibility,
   and working memory processes underlie age-related changes in strategic
   variations during arithmetic problem solving. We discuss both behavioral
   and neural mechanisms underlying age-related changes in these executive
   control processes.},

Abstract = {Trait resilience is a stable personality characteristic that involves
   the self-reported ability to flexibly adapt to emotional events and
   situations. The present study examined cognitive processes that may
   explain individual differences in trait resilience. Participants
   completed self-report measures of trait resilience, cognitive
   flexibility and working memory capacity tasks, and a novel affective
   task-switching paradigm that assesses the ability to flexibly switch
   between processing the affective versus non-affective qualities of
   affective stimuli (i.e., flexible affective processing). As
   hypothesised, cognitive flexibility and flexible affective processing
   were unique predictors of trait resilience. Working memory capacity was
   not predictive of trait resilience, indicating that trait resilience is
   tied to specific cognitive processes rather than overall better
   cognitive functioning. Cognitive flexibility and flexible affective
   processing were not associated with other trait measures, suggesting
   that these flexibility processes are unique to trait resilience. This
   study was among the first to investigate the cognitive abilities
   underlying trait resilience.},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {The present study investigated the impact of bilingualism on efficiency
   of alerting, orienting and executive attention by means of the
   Lateralized Attention Network Test (LANT). Young adult bilinguals who
   had been exposed to their second language before the age of four years
   showed a reduced conflict cost and a larger alerting effect in terms of
   response time (RT), while no difference between bilinguals and
   monolinguals was observed in overall RT. Bilinguals also outperformed
   monolinguals on accuracy in both conflict and non-conflict trials,
   though the effect in the latter condition was very small. Moreover,
   while a left visual field advantage for accuracy of conflict resolution
   was present in the monolingual group, bilinguals did not show the
   asymmetry. The findings suggest that bilingualism enhances the
   efficiency of executive network while reducing its lateralization. The
   larger alerting effect in bilinguals is hypothesized to be related to
   bilinguals' more efficient executive control, which may support
   processes of response anticipation or temporal orienting.},

Journal = {COGNITION \& EMOTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {30},
Number = {5},
Pages = {925-938},
Abstract = {The effects of emotion on working memory and executive control are often
   studied in isolation. Positive mood enhances verbal and impairs spatial
   working memory, whereas negative mood enhances spatial and impairs
   verbal working memory. Moreover, positive mood enhances executive
   control, whereas negative mood has little influence. We examined how
   emotion influences verbal and spatial working memory capacity, which
   requires executive control to coordinate between holding information in
   working memory and completing a secondary task. We predicted that
   positive mood would improve both verbal and spatial working memory
   capacity because of its influence on executive control. Positive,
   negative and neutral moods were induced followed by completing a verbal
   (Experiment 1) or spatial (Experiment 2) working memory operation span
   task to assess working memory capacity. Positive mood enhanced working
   memory capacity irrespective of the working memory domain, whereas
   negative mood had no influence on performance. Thus, positive mood was
   more successful holding information in working memory while processing
   task-irrelevant information, suggesting that the influence mood has on
   executive control supersedes the independent effects mood has on
   domain-specific working memory.},

Abstract = {Research in adults has aimed to characterize constraints on the capacity
   of Visual Working Memory (VWM), in part because of the system's broader
   impacts throughout cognition. However, less is known about how VWM
   develops in childhood. Existing work has reached conflicting conclusions
   as to whether VWM storage capacity increases after infancy, and if so,
   when and by how much. One challenge is that previous studies did not
   control for developmental changes in attention and executive processing,
   which also may undergo improvement. We investigated the development of
   VWM storage capacity in children from 3 to 8 years of age, and in
   adults, while controlling for developmental change in exogenous and
   endogenous attention and executive control. Our results reveal that,
   when controlling for improvements in these abilities, VWM storage
   capacity increases across development and approaches adult-like levels
   between ages 6 and 8 years. More generally, this work highlights the
   value of estimating working memory, attention, perception, and
   decision-making components together.},

Abstract = {Psychosocial stress influences cognitive abilities, such as long-term
   memory retrieval. However, less is known about the effects of stress on
   cognitive flexibility, which is mediated by different neurobiological
   circuits and could thus be regulated by different neuroendocrine

   stress induction or control condition and subsequently assessed
   participants' cognitive flexibility using an open-source version of the
   Wisconsin Card Sort task. Drawing on work in rodents, we hypothesized
   that stress would have stronger impairing effects on cognitive
   flexibility in men than women. As predicted, we found that stress
   impaired cognitive flexibility in men but did not significantly affect
   women. Our results thus indicate that stress exerts sex-specific effects
   on cognitive flexibility in humans and add to the growing body of
   research highlighting the need to consider sex differences in effects of

Abstract = {The rate at which people process information appears to influence many
   aspects of cognition across the lifespan. However, many commonly
   accepted measures of processing speed' may require goal maintenance,
   manipulation of information in working memory, and decision-making,
   blurring the distinction between processing speed and executive control
   and resulting in overestimation of processing speed contributions to
   cognition. This concern may apply particularly to studies of
   developmental change, as even seemingly simple processing speed measures
   may require executive processes to keep children and older adults on
   task. We report two new studies and a re-analysis of a published study,
   testing predictions about how different processing speed measures
   influence conclusions about executive control across the lifespan. We
   find that the choice of processing speed measure affects the
   relationship observed between processing speed and executive control, in
   a manner that changes with age, and that choice of processing speed
   measure affects conclusions about development and the relationship among
   executive control measures. Implications for understanding processing
   speed, executive control, and their development are discussed.},

Abstract = {Executive function (EF) deficits may underlie some of the impulse
   control problems seen in pathological gambling. Pathological gamblers
   (PGs, n = 45) and controls (n = 45) were compared on several measures of
   EF (including measures of response inhibition, working memory, cognitive
   flexibility and perseveration, planning and decision-making), as well as
   memory and intelligence tests to examine whether PGs evidence EF
   dysfunction. Compared with controls, PGs exhibited specific deficits on
   measures of planning and decision-making. PGs also exhibited relative
   deficits on a measure of perseveration, but this deficit was no longer
   significant after controlling for group differences in intelligence.
   These results suggest that PGs may experience deficits on specific
   components of EF.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {109},
Number = {3},
Pages = {353-370},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The current study addressed the role of switch detection in cognitive
   flexibility by testing the effect of transition cues (i.e., cues that
   directly signal the need to switch or maintain a given task goal) in a
   cued set-shifting paradigm at 5 years of age. Children performed better,
   especially on switch trials, when transition cues were combined with
   traditional task cues (i.e., cues that directly signal the relevant task
   on a given trial) relative to conditions without transition cues. This
   effect was not influenced by explicit knowledge of transition cues or
   transition cue transparency, suggesting that transition cues did not
   need to be semantically processed to be beneficial. These findings
   reveal that young children's difficulties in set-shifting situations
   stem partially from failures to monitor for the need to switch. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) often show impaired performance
   on visuospatial attentional tasks. The objective of the study was to
   examine the attentional function of PD patients performing the
   attentional network test (ANT). We used the ANT to compare PD patients
   with healthy controls with respect to the efficiency of 3 anatomically
   defined attentional networks: the alerting, orienting, and executive
   control networks. We found that PD patients showed a selective
   abnormality in the orienting network. Although the alerting and
   executive control networks apparently remained unaffected, the
   efficiencies of these networks in patients with PD negatively correlated
   with the Hoehn-Yahr stage. The results supported the idea that the
   orienting processes may be more dynamic in PD than in non-PD
   individuals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Neurocognitive functioning in compulsive buying disorder},
Journal = {ANNALS OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {57-63},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Compulsive buying (CB) is a fairly common behavioral problem
   estimated to affect 5.8\% of the population. Although previous research
   has examined the clinical characteristics of CB, little research has
   examined whether people with CB manifest cognitive deficits.
   METHODS: Twenty-three non-treatment-seeking compulsive buyers (mean age,
   22.3 +/- 3.5; 60.9\% female) and 23 age- and sex-matched healthy
   controls (mean age, 21.1 +/- 3.4, 60.9\% female) underwent
   neurocognitive assessment. We predicted that the following cognitive
   domains would be impaired in CB: spatial working memory (Spatial Working
   Memory test), response inhibition (Stop-Signal Task), cognitive
   flexibility (Intra-Extra Dimensional Set Shift task), and decision
   making (Cambridge Gambling Task).
   RESULTS: Compared with controls, individuals with CB exhibited
   significant impairments in response inhibition (P = .043), risk
   adjustment during decision making (P = .010), and spatial working memory
   (P = .041 total errors; P = .044 strategy scores). Deficits were of
   large effect size (Cohen's d, 0.6 to 1.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: These pilot data suggest that individuals with CB
   experience problems in several distinct cognitive domains, supporting a
   likely neurobiological overlap between CB and other putative behavioral
   and substance addictions. These findings may have implications for
   shared treatment approaches as well as how we currently classify and
   understand CB.},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {The sociocommunicative impairments that define autism spectrum disorder
   (ASD) are not present at birth but emerge gradually over the first two
   years of life. In typical development, basic attentional processes may
   provide a critical foundation for sociocommunicative abilities.
   Therefore early attentional dysfunction in ASD may result in atypical
   development of social communication. Prior research has demonstrated
   that persons with ASD exhibit early and lifelong impairments in
   attention. The primary aim of this paper is to provide a review of the
   extant research on attention in ASD using a framework of functionally
   independent attentional networks as conceptualized by Posner and
   colleagues: the alerting, orienting and executive control networks
   (Posner and Petersen, 1990; Petersen and Posner, 2012). The neural
   substrates and typical development of each attentional network are
   briefly discussed, a review of the ASD attention literature is
   presented, and a hypothesis is proposed that links aberrant attentional
   mechanisms, specifically impaired disengagement of attention, with the
   emergence of core ASD symptoms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Background. The aim of this study is to evaluate the executive
   functioning of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
   combined subtype (ADHD-C) and Asperger syndrome (AS) compared to a
   control group. Methods. A sample of 79 children (28 ADHD-C; 24 AS; 27
   subjects with typical development) was tested on a wide range of tasks
   related to major domains of executive functioning: inhibition response
   (prepotent and interference), visual working memory, planning and
   cognitive flexibility. Results. Patients with AS showed deficits on
   visual working memory and cognitive flexibility. ADHD-C children were
   impaired on inhibition control (prepotent response) but also showed
   deficits on working memory and cognitive flexibility. The only executive
   functioning measure that differentiated ADHD from AS was inhibition of
   prepotent response and a more high deficit in cognitive flexibility and
   working memory in AS compared to ADHD-C. Conclusions. This study
   confirms recent evidence about the identification of specific executive
   profiles in these disorders. Other studies are warranted to evaluate the
   presence and specifity of a dysexecutive syndrome in ADHD and AS in a
   larger sample with girls.},

Title = {Working Memory and Cognitive Load in the Legal System: Influences on
   Police Shooting Decisions, Interrogation and Jury Decisions},

Abstract = {The ability of police and jurors to make informed, unbiased decisions is
   paramount to the integrity of the legal system. Police and jurors as
   decision-makers follow procedures ensuring that individuals receive a
   fair trial from the time of arrest to sentencing. However this process
   has come under public scrutiny with recent negative media attention
   focused on police shootings, aggressive handling or interrogation of
   suspects, and jurors' seemingly biased treatment of minority group
   members. Most researchers studying factors that motivate police and
   juror behavior focus on the external influences of decision-making, such
   as the climate of violence in a neighborhood, or culturally-entrenched
   criminal stereotypes. Fewer have focused on the cognitive factors that
   impact the internal decision-making processes. In this review we compile
   the research on individual differences in cognitive ability (e.g.,
   working memory capacity) and event circumstances (e.g., high emotion,
   attention load), that influence police and jury decision-making. The
   majority of studies in this area are laboratory-based which may
   attenuate the transfer of findings to real-world settings, but cognitive
   mechanisms engaged in the field are likely similar. Overall, this review
   suggests that overload of cognitive capacity reduces controlled
   processing ability, which may work to undermine the reliability of
   decision-making at all phases of the legal process. Field studies are
   needed to better understand when decision-makers may be overburdened,
   and what interventions are most appropriate.},

Title = {Age-related changes in electrophysiological and neuropsychological
   indices of working memory, attention control, and cognitive flexibility},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {2},
Abstract = {Older adults exhibit great variability in their cognitive abilities,
   with some maintaining high levels of performance on executive control
   tasks and others showing significant deficits. Previous event-related
   potential (ERR) work has shown that some of these performance
   differences are correlated with persistence of the novelty/frontal P3 in
   older adults elicited by task-relevant events, presumably reflecting
   variability in the capacity to suppress orienting to unexpected but no
   longer novel events. In recent ERR work in young adults, we showed that
   the operation-span (OSPAN) task (a measure of attention control) is
   predictive of the ability of individuals to keep track of stimulus
   sequencing and to maintain running mental representations of task
   stimuli, as indexed by the parietally distributed P300 (or P3b). Both of
   these phenomena reflect aspects of frontal function (cognitive
   flexibility and attention control, respectively). To investigate these
   phenomena we sorted both younger and older adults into low-and
   high-working memory spans and low and high cognitive flexibility
   subgroups, and examined ERPs during an equal probability choice reaction
   time task. For both age groups (a) participants with high OSPAN scores
   were better able to keep track of stimulus sequencing, as indicated by
   their smaller P3b to sequential changes; and (b) participants with lower
   cognitive flexibility had larger P3a than their high-scoring
   counterparts. However; these two phenomena did not interact suggesting
   that they manifest dissociable control mechanisms. Further, the fact
   that both effects are already visible in younger adults suggests that at
   least some of the brain mechanisms underlying individual differences in
   cognitive aging may already operate early in life.},

Title = {Age effects on transfer index performance and executive control in
   baboons (Papio papio)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Reversal performance in the transfer index (TI) task is known to improve
   from prosimians to apes, suggesting that this task is a marker of
   cognitive evolution within the primate taxa (Rurnbaugh, 1970). However,
   the cognitive processes recruited by this task remain unclear. In the
   present study, 19 socially-housed baboons (Papio papio) from 1.6 to 14.3
   years of age were tested on a computerized version of the TI task, using
   an automated self-testing procedure. Age was a significant factor in the
   level of success, with the younger baboons outperforming the adults. The
   younger baboons learned the pre-reversal discrimination faster and
   improved their post-reversal performance more rapidly than adult
   baboons. As 17 of these baboons had already been tested in previous
   studies on inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility tasks,
   comparison across tasks provide indicators of the underlying cognitive
   processes. Age variations in performance were similar between the TI
   task and in an adaptation of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST)
   measuring cognitive flexibility (Bente et al., 2011). This contrasts
   previous results from a task requiring motor inhibitory control (Fagot
   et al., 2011). Therefore, these findings suggest that cognitive
   flexibility was a central component of the cognitive system that evolved
   within non-human primates. They also implicate a decline in executive
   control with age that begins during early adulthood in this baboon
   species.},

Title = {Executive control training from middle childhood to adolescence},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {Executive functions (EFs) include a number of higher-level cognitive
   control abilities, such as cognitive flexibility, inhibition, and
   working memory, which are instrumental in supporting action control and
   the flexible adaptation changing environments. These control functions
   are supported by the prefrontal cortex and therefore develop rapidly
   across childhood and mature well into late adolescence. Given that
   executive control is a strong predictor for various life outcomes, such
   as academic achievement, socioeconomic status, and physical health,
   numerous training interventions have been designed to improve executive
   functioning across the lifespan, many of them targeting children and
   adolescents. Despite the increasing popularity of these trainings, their
   results are neither robust nor consistent, and the transferability of
   training-induced performance improvements to untrained tasks seems to be
   limited. In this review, we provide a selective overview of the
   developmental literature on process-based cognitive interventions by
   discussing (1) the concept and the development of EFs and their neural
   underpinnings, (2) the effects of different types of executive control
   training in normally developing children and adolescents, (3) individual
   differences in training-related performance gains as well as (4) the
   potential of cognitive training interventions for the application in
   clinical and educational contexts. Based on recent findings, we consider
   how transfer of process-based executive control trainings may be
   supported and how interventions may be tailored to the needs of specific
   age groups or populations.},

Abstract = {Cognitive theories of emotion try to explain how anxious people attend
   to the world. Despite the increase in empirical research in this field,
   the specific or general attentional impairments of patients with anxiety
   disorder is not well defined. We decided to investigate the relationship
   between pathological anxiety and attentional mechanisms from the broader
   perspective of the attentional networks. In our study, patients with
   anxiety disorders and control participants carried out a task to assess
   efficiency of three attentional networks: orienting, alerting, and
   executive control. The main result was that anxiety disorders are
   related to both reduced effectiveness of the executive control network
   and difficulties in disengaging attention from invalid cues, even when
   using emotionally neutral information. This relationship between these
   attentional networks and anxiety may in part explain the problems in the
   day-to-day functioning of these patients. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Number = {4},
Pages = {789-795},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Although cognitive neuroscience has made remarkable progress in
   understanding the involvement of the prefrontal cortex in human memory,
   the necessity of the orbitofrontal cortex for key competencies of
   working memory remains largely unexplored. We therefore studied human
   brain lesion patients to determine whether the orbitofrontal cortex is
   necessary for working memory function, administering subtests of the
   Wechsler memory scale, the Wechsler adult intelligence scale, and the
   n-back task to 3 participant groups: orbitofrontal lesions (n = 24),
   prefrontal lesions not involving orbitofrontal cortex (n = 40), and no
   brain lesions (n = 54). Orbitofrontal damage was reliably associated
   with deficits on neuropsychological tests involving the coordination of
   working memory maintenance, manipulation, and monitoring processes
   (n-back task) but not on pure tests of working memory maintenance
   (digit/spatial span forward) or manipulation (digit/spatial span
   backward and letter-number sequencing). Our findings elucidate a central
   component of the neural architecture of working memory, providing key
   neuropsychological evidence for the necessity of the orbitofrontal
   cortex in executive control functions underlying the joint maintenance,
   manipulation, and monitoring of information in working memory.},

Title = {Executive functioning and reading achievement in school: a study of

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {This study examined executive functioning and reading achievement in 106
   6- to 8-year-old Brazilian children from a range of social backgrounds
   of whom approximately half lived below the poverty line. A particular
   focus was to explore the executive function profile of children whose
   classroom reading performance was judged below standard by their
   teachers and who were matched to controls on chronological age, sex,
   school type (private or public), domicile (Salvador/BA or Sao Paulo/SP)
   and socioeconomic status. Children completed a battery of 12 executive
   function tasks that were conceptual tapping cognitive flexibility,
   working memory, inhibition and selective attention. Each executive
   function domain was assessed by several tasks. Principal component
   analysis extracted four factors that were labeled ``Working
   Memory/Cognitive Flexibility,{''} ``Interference Suppression,{''}
   ``Selective Attention,{''} and ``Response Inhibition.{''} Individual
   differences in executive functioning components made differential
   contributions to early reading achievement. The Working Memory/Cognitive
   Flexibility factor emerged as the best predictor of reading. Group
   comparisons on computed factor scores showed that struggling readers
   displayed limitations in Working Memory/Cognitive Flexibility, but not
   in other executive function components, compared to more skilled
   readers. These results validate the account that working memory capacity
   provides a crucial building block for the development of early literacy
   skills and extends it to a population of early readers of Portuguese
   from Brazil. The study suggests that deficits in working
   memory/cognitive flexibility might represent one contributing factor to
   reading difficulties in early readers. This might have important
   implications for how educators might intervene with children at risk of
   academic under achievement.},

Title = {Training on Working Memory and Inhibitory Control in Young Adults},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Different types of interventions have focused on trying to improve
   Executive Functions (EFs) due to their essential role in human cognition
   and behavior regulation. Although EFs are thought to be diverse, most
   training studies have targeted cognitive processes related to working
   memory (WM), and fewer have focused on training other control
   mechanisms, such as inhibitory control (IC). In the present study, we
   aimed to investigate the differential impact of training WM and IC as
   compared with control conditions performing non-executive control
   activities. Young adults were divided into two training (WM/IC) and two
   (active/passive) control conditions. Over six sessions, the training
   groups engaged in three different computer-based adaptive activities pm
   or IC), whereas the active control group completed a program with low
   control-demanding activities that mainly involved processing speed. In
   addition, motivation and engagement were monitored through the training.
   The WM-training activities required maintenance, updating and memory
   search processes, while those from the IC group engaged response
   inhibition and interference control. All participants were pre- and
   post-tested in criterion tasks (n-back and Stroop), near transfer
   measures of WM (Operation Span) and IC (Stop-Signal). Non-trained far
   transfer outcome measures included an abstract reasoning test (Raven's
   Advanced Progressive Matrices) and a well-validated experimental task
   (AX-CPT) that provides indices of cognitive flexibility considering
   proactive/reactive control. Training results revealed that strongly
   motivated participants reached higher levels of training improvements.
   Regarding transfer effects, results showed specific patterns of near
   transfer effects depending on the type of training. Interestingly, it
   was only the IC training group that showed far transfer to reasoning.
   Finally, all trained participants showed a shift toward a more proactive
   mode of cognitive control, highlighting a general effect of training on
   cognitive flexibility. The present results reveal specific and general
   modulations of executive control mechanisms after brief training
   intervention targeting either WM or IC.},

Abstract = {Working memory consists of domain-specific storage facilities and
   domain-general executive control processes. In some working memory
   theories, these control processes are accounted for via a homunculus,
   the central executive. In the present article, the author defends a
   mechanistic view of executive control by adopting the position that
   executive control is situated in the context of goal-directed behavior
   to maintain and protect the goal and to select an action to attain the
   goal. On the basis of findings in task switching and dual tasking, he
   proposes an adapted multicomponent working memory model in which the
   central executive is replaced by three interacting components: an
   executive memory that maintains the task set, a collection of acquired
   procedural rules, and an engine that executes the procedural rules that
   match the ensemble of working memory contents. The strongest among the
   rules that match the ensemble of working memory contents is applied,
   resulting in changes of the working memory contents or in motor actions.
   According to this model, goals are attained when the route to the goals
   is known or can be searched when the route is unknown (problem solving).
   Empirical evidence for this proposal and new predictions are discussed.},

Abstract = {The study investigated whether successful transfer of game-based
   cognitive improvements to untrained tasks might be modulated by
   preexisting neuro-developmental factors, such as genetic variability
   related to the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-an enzyme responsible
   for the degradation of dopamine. The COMT Val(158)Met genotype may
   differentially affect cognitive stability and flexibility, and we
   hypothesized that Val/Val homozygous individuals (who possess low
   prefrontal dopamine levels) show more pronounced cognitive flexibility
   than Met/-carriers (who possess high prefrontal dopamine levels). We
   trained participants, genotyped for the COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism on
   playing ``Half-Life 2{''}, a first-person shooter game which has been
   shown to improve cognitive flexibility. Pre-training (baseline) and
   post-training measures of cognitive flexibility were acquired by means
   of a task-switching paradigm. As expected, Val/Val homozygous
   individuals showed larger beneficial transfer effects than
   Met/-carriers. Our findings support the idea that genetic predisposition
   modulates transfer effects and that playing first-person shooter games
   promotes cognitive flexibility in individuals with a suitable genetic
   predisposition.},

Title = {The effects of acute stress on core executive functions: A meta-analysis
   and comparison with cortisol},
Journal = {NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {68},
Pages = {651-668},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Core executive functions such as working memory, inhibition, and
   cognitive flexibility are integral to daily life. A growing body of
   research has suggested that acute stress may impair core executive
   functions. However, there are a number of inconsistencies in the
   literature, leading to uncertainty about how or even if acute stress
   influences core executive functions. We addressed this by conducting a
   meta-analysis of acute stress effects on working memory, inhibition, and
   cognitive flexibility. We found that stress impaired working memory and
   cognitive flexibility, whereas it had nuanced effects on inhibition.
   Many of these effects were moderated by other variables, such as sex. In
   addition, we compared effects of acute stress on core executive
   functions to effects of cortisol administration and found some striking
   differences. Our findings indicate that stress works through mechanisms
   aside from or in addition to cortisol to produce a state characterized
   by more reactive processing of salient stimuli but greater control over
   actions. We conclude by highlighting some important future directions
   for stress and executive function research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Probability matching behavior occurs in a variety of decision-making

   other decision-making functions of prefrontal cortex such as recognizing
   sequences of symbols or visual scenes. In this work, we emulate
   probability matching behavior from human subjects using the PBWM model
   in n-arm bandit-like problems. Possible extensions to the current work
   such as including other biases like loss aversion and misperception of
   both large gains and losses are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC 18},
Abstract = {We investigated the relationship between working memory capacity (WMC)
   and workload capacity (WLC). Each participant performed an operation
   span (OSPAN) task to measure his/her WMC and three redundant-target
   detection tasks to measure his/her WLC. WLC was computed
   non-parametrically (Experiments 1 and 2) and parametrically (Experiment
   2). Both levels of analyses showed that participants high in WMC had
   larger WLC than those low in WMC only when redundant information came
   from visual and auditory modalities, suggesting that high-WMC
   participants had superior processing capacity in dealing with redundant
   visual and auditory information. This difference was eliminated when
   multiple processes required processing for only a single working memory
   subsystem in a color-shape detection task and a double-dot detection
   task. These results highlighted the role of executive control in
   integrating and binding information from the two working memory
   subsystems for perceptual decision making.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to assess attention in recently diagnosed
   relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients. Twenty-seven patients
   with early multiple sclerosis and low clinical disability scores
   (EDSS<2) and 27 sex-, age-, and education-matched healthy controls
   underwent attention assessment using the Attentional Network Test, a
   computerized task designed to measure efficiency independently in 3
   attentional networks (Alerting, Orienting and Executive Control). MS
   patients had significantly less efficiency in the Alerting network (p =
   .006). In contrast, in the Orienting and Executive Control networks,
   they did not differ from controls. A significant interaction between
   Alerting and Executive Control was also found in the MS patients (p =
   .007). Early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis particularly affects
   the Alerting domain of attention, whereas the Orienting and Executive
   Control domains are not affected. (JINS, 2012, 18, 757-763)},

Abstract = {Attentional dysfunction is among the most consistent observations of
   autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the neural nature of this
   deficit in ASD is still unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the
   neurobehavioral correlates of attentional dysfunction in ASD. We used
   the Attention Network Test-Revised and functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to examine alerting, orienting, and executive control functions,
   as well as the neural substrates underlying these attentional functions
   in unmedicated, high-functioning adults with ASD (n = 12) and matched
   healthy controls (HC, n = 12). Compared with HC, individuals with ASD
   showed increased error rates in alerting and executive control,
   accompanied by lower activity in the mid-frontal gyrus and the caudate
   nucleus for alerting, and by the absence of significant functional
   activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for executive control.
   In addition, greater behavioral deficiency in executive control in ASD
   was correlated with less functional activation of the ACC. These
   findings of behavioral and neural abnormalities in alerting and
   executive control of attention in ASD may suggest core attentional
   deficits, which require further investigation.},

Volume = {73},

Abstract = {Offering reward for performance can motivate people to perform a task
   better, but better preparation for one task usually means decreased
   flexibility to perform different tasks. In six experiments in which
   reward varied between low and high levels, we found that reward can
   encourage people to prepare more flexibly for different tasks, but only
   as it increased from the level on the previous trial. When the same high
   rewards were offered continuously trial after trial, people were more
   inclined to simply stick with doing what had worked previously. We
   demonstrated such enhancements in flexibility in task switching, a
   difficult visual search task, and an easier priming of pop-out search
   task, which shows that this effect generalizes from executive tasks to
   perceptual processes that require relatively little executive control.
   These findings suggest that relative, transient changes in reward can
   exert more potent effects on behavioral flexibility than can the
   absolute amount of reward, whether it consists of money or points in a
   social competition.},

Abstract = {Several judgment and decision-making tasks are assumed to involve memory
   functions, but significant knowledge gaps on the memory processes
   underlying these tasks remain. In a study on 568 adults between 25 and
   80 years of age, hypotheses were tested on the specific relationships
   between individual differences in working memory, episodic memory, and
   semantic memory, respectively, and 6 main components of decision-making
   competence, In line with the hypotheses, working memory was positively
   related with the more cognitively demanding tasks (Resistance to
   Framing, Applying Decision Rules, and Under/Overconfidence), whereas
   episodic memory was positively associated with a more experience-based
   judgment task (Recognizing Social Norms). Furthermore, semantic memory
   was positively related with 2 more knowledge-based decision-making tasks
   (Consistency in Risk Perception and Resistance to Sunk Costs). Finally,
   the age-related decline observed in some of the decision-making tasks
   was (partially or totally) mediated by the age-related decline in
   working memory or episodic memory. These findings are discussed in
   relation to the functional roles fulfilled by different memory processes
   in judgment and decision-making tasks.},

Abstract = {Recently, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CAMKK2 gene
   (rs1063843) was found to be associated with lower expression of the gene
   in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and with schizophrenia
   (SCZ) and deficits in working memory and executive function. However,
   the brain mechanism underlying this association is poorly understood. A
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study (N = 84 healthy
   volunteers) involving multiple cognitive tasks, including a Stroop task
   (to measure attentional executive control), an N-back task (to measure
   working memory), and a delay discounting task (to measure decision
   making) to identify the brain regions affected by rs1063843 was
   performed. Across all three tasks, it was found that carriers of the
   risk allele consistently exhibited increased activation of the left
   DLPFC. In addition, the risk allele carriers also exhibited increased
   activation of the right DLPFC and the left cerebellum during the Stroop
   task and of the left caudate nucleus during the N-back task. These
   findings helped to elucidate the role of CAMKK2 in cognitive functions
   and in the etiology of SCZ. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {People's minds sometimes wander from ongoing activities. Although these
   experiences can be pleasant and useful, they are often unintentional and
   precipitate mistakes. In this article, we adopt an
   individual-differences perspective in considering unwanted mind
   wandering as an indicator of both momentary failures of and enduring
   deficiencies in executive-control functions. We describe research that
   associates normal variation in working memory capacity (WMC)-a cognitive
   ability that broadly predicts intellectual capabilities and
   accomplishments-with off-task thinking. In laboratory and daily-life
   assessments, people with lower WMC mind wander more frequently than do
   those with higher WMC, at least during demanding tasks. Moreover, the
   error-proneness of lower-WMC subjects seems to arise partly from their
   vulnerability to mind wandering. Executive control over one's thoughts
   therefore seems to contribute to the effective regulation of behavior.},

Abstract = {Negative stereotypes about aging can impair older adults' memory via
   stereotype threat; however, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon
   are unclear. In two experiments, we tested competing predictions derived
   from two theoretical accounts of stereotype threat: executive-control
   interference and regulatory fit. Older adults completed a working memory
   test either under stereotype threat about age-related memory declines or
   not under such threat. Monetary incentives were manipulated such that
   recall led to gains or forgetting led to losses. The
   executive-control-interference account predicts that stereotype threat
   decreases the availability of executive-control resources and hence
   should impair working memory performance. The regulatory-fit account
   predicts that threat induces a prevention focus, which should impair
   performance when gains are emphasized but improve performance when
   losses are emphasized. Results were consistent only with the
   regulatory-fit account. Although stereotype threat significantly
   impaired older adults' working memory performance when remembering led
   to gains, it significantly improved performance when forgetting led to
   losses.},

   withholding a prepotent response to an infrequent target, when at the
   same time placing a low or high load on an unrelated working memory
   task. Working memory load had the effect of reducing accuracy on the go
   trials, when at the same time increasing accuracy on the no-go trials.
   We interpret these findings to suggest that high working memory load led

Abstract = {The controlled attention theory of working memory capacity (WMC, Engle
   2002) suggests that WMC represents a domain free limitation in the
   ability to control attention and is predictive of an individual's
   capability of staying focused, avoiding distraction and impulsive
   errors. In the present paper we test the predictive power of WMC in
   computer-based sport decision-making tasks. Experiment I demonstrated
   that high-WMC athletes were better able at focusing their attention on
   tactical decision making while blocking out irrelevant auditory
   distraction. Experiment 2 showed that high-WMC athletes were more
   successful at adapting their tactical decision making according to the
   situation instead of relying on prepotent inappropriate decisions. The
   present results provide additional but also unique support for the
   controlled attention theory of WMC by demonstrating that WMC is
   predictive of controlling attention in complex settings among different
   modalities and highlight the importance of working memory in tactical
   decision making.},

Abstract = {Depression has been linked to executive dysfunction and emotion
   recognition impairments, associated with abnormalities in
   fronto-temporal and subcortical brain regions. Little is known about
   changes of different empathy subcomponents during depression, with
   potential impairments being related to the interpersonal difficulties of
   depressed patients. Twenty patients treated for an episode of unipolar
   depression and 20 matched healthy controls were assessed. Measures of
   dispositional and behavioural empathy components were administered along
   with tests of cognitive flexibility, response inhibition and working
   memory. Relative to controls, depressed patients showed higher
   self-reported dispositional empathy scores, mainly driven by increased
   personal distress scores. Patients and controls did not differ
   significantly in terms of behavioural cognitive empathy, empathic
   concern and personal affective involvement or in their executive
   function performance. In the patients, cognitive flexibility and
   response inhibition accuracy were associated with behavioural empathy.
   While an increased disposition towards feeling personal distress in
   response to other people's suffering seems to be in generally related to
   depressive symptoms, behavioural empathy might depend on the functional
   integrity of executive control during an episode of clinical depression.
   Impairments in this regard could contribute to the interpersonal
   difficulties depressed patients are frequently faced with which might
   have important implications for treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {The effects of eccentricity on the attentional modulation of visual
   discrimination have been widely studied; however, the substrate of this
   complex phenomenon is poorly understood. Here, we provided a measure of
   the effects of eccentricity on three attentional networks: alerting,
   orienting, and executive attention. Participants (N=63) were tested with
   a modified attention network test that included an additional
   eccentricity variation; this test allowed us to investigate the
   efficiency of the attentional networks at near and far eccentricities.
   Compared with targets at the near eccentricity, targets at the far
   eccentricity generally elicited significantly longer reaction times. We
   also found the far eccentricity was associated with smaller orienting
   effect scores and larger executive control scores than the near
   eccentricity. Interestingly, at the near eccentricity, executive control
   scores were larger when the spatial information was neutral (no cue,
   center cue, and double cue), but at the far eccentricity, the scores
   were larger when the spatial information was valid (spatial cue). We
   propose that the allocation of attentional resources differed among
   these cue conditions and influenced the interference caused by
   conflicting information.},
