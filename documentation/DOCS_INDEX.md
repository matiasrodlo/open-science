When using these documents with LLMs:

1. **Start with ARCHITECTURE.md** for system understanding
2. **Reference API_REFERENCE.md** for implementation details
3. **Use DEVELOPMENT.md** for code-related questions
4. **Consult DEPLOYMENT.md** for operational concerns

### For Human Readers
When navigating these documents:

1. **Begin with README.md** for project overview
2. **Choose relevant guide** based on your role:
   - Users → README.md + data/README.md
   - Developers → DEVELOPMENT.md + ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Administrators → DEPLOYMENT.md + ARCHITECTURE.md
3. **Reference API_REFERENCE.md** for technical details
